## Overview:
see.saw is a web app designed to simplify and streamline playground discovery so that users can get out there and P L A Y. Users can explore, create, curate, filter, and search for playgrounds in the Nashville area--all in one playfully designed and easy-to-use application. 

## Features:
***Playgrounds***
* Authenticated users have access to peruse all playgrounds on their homepage.
* Additional details for each playground include its neighborhood, address, features, a "hot tip" to know before visiting, and its location on an interactive Google map.
* Ability to create and submit new playgrounds to be added to the public collection.
* Simple buttons on each playground card allow users to check off playgrounds they have visited, as well as "favorite" the very best ones.

***Neighborhoods***
* Users can browse Nashville's neighborhoods and view a list of playgrounds within a given area. Explore the hidden gems in your own neighborhood!
* New neighborhoods can be created to encompass new cities or other pockets of town if desired.

***Play Map***
* View the locations of every playground on one big, interactive Google Map to get a sense of where playgrounds are relative to your location.
* When a new playground is created, the play map is automatically updated with a marker for the new location.
* When a map marker is clicked, a modal displays the playground's address.

***User Profile***
* Each user's unique profile includes basic stats: their profile picture, email, and time of last login.
* When a playground is marked as "visited" (by clicking the checkmark button), it is added to the user's visited list, and the grand total of visited playgrounds is updated in the user's profile. How many can you visit?!
* When a playground is marked as a "favorite" (by clicking the heart button), it is added to the user's favorites list, visible as cards in the user's profile. Easily keep track of the best ones and let kids choose where they'd like to play from the playground images.

Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, babysitters, camp counselors, and other caregivers of all kinds will reap the benefits of this app--*hopefully,* spending less time finding the perfect playground and more time PLAYING.
